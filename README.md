# 🧠 Deep Learning Projects

A collection of projects related to machine learning and deep learning.  
Each folder contains an individual project with datasets, a notebook, and a description.  

## 📋 List of projects

- [Project 1 – Japanese Universities](./japanese_universities/README.md)  
  *This project implements a Deep Learning model in PyTorch designed to classify schools into difficulty tiers (S, A, B, C, D, E, F) based on their characteristics and performance data.*  
- [Project 2 – Flowers](./flowers/README.md)  
  *The goal of this project is to classify flower images into five categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch. The model learns visual patterns such as color, shape, and texture to correctly identify the flower species.*  

## 🚀 How to use
1. Go to the chosen project folder.  
2. Read the local `README.md` for detailed instructions.  
3. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
