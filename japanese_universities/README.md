# üìå Project: [Japanese Univiersities]

## üéØ Goal
*The network assigns school rankings based on features such as the number of reviews, department count, whether the school offers graduate programs, remote learning availability, and several other attributes. What‚Äôs interesting is that using these factors, we can predict a school's difficulty level with reasonable accuracy.*

## üìä Data
- **File:** `japanese_universities.csv`  
- **Data source:** [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/japanese-universities)  
- **Description:** Comprehensive Japanese University data since 1872. Contains 813 university information collected from the Japan Ministry of Education and two other online sources.

## üß† Model
- **Type:** MLP 
- **Framework:** PyTorch 2.7.1+cpu
- **Architecture:**  
  - **Layers:**  
    - `Linear(input_dim ‚Üí 16)`  
    - `ReLU` activation  
    - `Linear(16 ‚Üí 8)`  
    - `ReLU` activation
